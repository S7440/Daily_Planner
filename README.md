# Daily_Planner

## Description

This project was supposed to create a planner that helps schedule a persons day. Ideally it displays the day at the top of the calendar, and below that you will see time blocks from 9-5.

In these time blocks you're able to input an event and save that event to local storage for viewing at a later date. You're also able to differentiate between past, present, and future with colour coding. Unfortunately none of this really happened, I was dumb and procrastinated.
